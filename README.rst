LOFAR Transients Pipeline
=========================

The LOFAR Transients Pipeline (or "Trap") is a Python and SQL based system for
detecting and responding to transient and variable sources in a stream of
astronomical images. It primarily targets LOFAR data, but is also applicable
to a range of other instruments.
