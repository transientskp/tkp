- To make the HTML version of the documentation, use::

      make html

  You can then find the starting point at build/html/index.html

  To create a PDF version of the documentation, use::

      make latexpdf

  You can then find the PDF at build/latex/TKPAPI.pdf


  You may need to clean the build directory to allow for changes
  to become visible::

      make clean

  For more options, see the Makefile

- Edit source/conf.py if you want to change options or overall settings
  (such as the main title, authors or copyright).

- These docs (or at least the conf.py and Makefile) was generated
  using Sphinx 1.0.7. If you use an older version, you may have
  problems generating the HTML or PDF documentation.

- For an example of how to use Sphinx, see eg 
  http://packages.python.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html

  More details are of course at the Sphinx pages, eg:

  - http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

  - http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/desc.html

  - http://sphinx.pocoo.org/domains.html#python-roles


- I have followed the Google Python code documentation convention to
  document args, kwargs and return values, found at
  http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html#Comments
  (also discussed in the above "example pypi project").
