This documents deals (shortly) with writing software for the
Transients Pipeline, either the TraP part (recipes) or the underlying
modules (the TKP package).


TKP
===

The TKP package is a set of modules (or actually modules within four
subpackages) that implement the algorithms used by the transients
pipeline. The subpackages are:

- database

- sourcefinder

- classification

- utility

The names of the subpackages should speak for themselves; utility is
more or less a collection of code that does not really fit anywhere
else, or ties a few subpackages together (such as the database and
sourcefinder).

The main thing to keep in mind when writing (new) code is that the
subpackages are, as much as possible, independent of each other. There
are some minor dependencies still among the packages, but these will
hopefully be removed in the future. Other than that, the individual
module names should give one a good idea what code to put where. An
overview of the most used modules and a short description of their
task follows:

- database

  - database: take care of database connection

  - dataset: mini-ORM to some database tables

  - utils: all the SQL queries inside their respective Python functions

- sourcefinder

  - image: image (data) handling through the Image class

  - extract: source extraction routines

  - fitting: actual source fitting routines

  - gaussian: 2D gaussian function 

  - stats: specific statistic routines

  - utils: some sourcefinder specific utilities

- classification

  - manual: subpackage for manual classification

    - transient: define transient class

    - classifier: classifier routines

    - classification: defines the classification (decision tree); can be user overriden

    - utils: utility classes for the transient class

  - features: feature detection subpackage

    - lightcurve: obtain characteristics of the transient light curve

    - catalog: catalog (position) matching routines

    - sql: SQL routines (to be integrated into the lightcurve module)

- utility:

  - accessors: (Image) data file handling classes

  - containers: classes for handling the sourcefinder results

  - coordinates: various coordinate handling routines, and WCS class

  - fits: few routines to handle MS to FITS metadata and combination (stacking) of FITS files

  - memoize: decorator to cache results of methods

  - sigmaclip: generic kapp, sigma clipping routine (used by classification.features)

  - uncertain: Uncertainty class that can hold a value plus its errors

  - exceptions: a few (rarely used) TKP exception classes


Builds
======

The installation procedure is described in :ref:`the TRAP installation
documentation <trap:installation>`. This section summarizes the nightly build
procedure on the ``heastro`` system in Amsterdam.

A build is performed at 04:30 every morning. This build is currently performed
by the script ``/zfs/heastro-plex/scratch/swinbank/build/build-tkp.sh``. It
builds and installs the HEAD of the ``master`` branch of both the
`transientskp/tkp <https://github.com/transientskp/tkp/>`_ and
`transientskp/trap <https://github.com/transientskp/trap>`_ repositories.
Files are installed under ``/opt/tkp/${BUILD_DATE}`` and, after successful
installation, the symlink ``/opt/tkp/latest`` is pointed at that location.
Thus, end-users can always access the latest successful build as
``/opt/tkp/latest/``.

The file ``/opt/tkp/init.sh`` may be sourced (ie, run ``. /opt/tkp/init.sh``
at your prompt) by ``bash`` shell users to set all the necessary environment
variables to run the TKP code.

Logs of all build attempts are available under ``/opt/tkp/logs``.

Coding guidelines
=================

We try to follow PEP 8 as much as possible, although at times, this is
flexible (e.g., short variable names sometimes make more sense in the
context; and there is no hard rule where braces or parentheses should
go when they cover more than one line).

Occasionally, it may be useful to run pylint (or similar) on the code,
to pick out a few things (unused variables and such). Don't aim to get
a 10/10 score, just use the suggestions by pylint where deemed
applicable.



Documentation
=============

All documentation in the `code` part of the TKP repository is written
in restructured text, whether doc strings or longer documents, and is
then put together and transformed using Sphinx. By 'put together', we
mean that Sphinx will pick up the doc strings from referenced modules
and add this to the other documentation; by transformed we mean the
Sphinx will create HTML pages out of the documentation. The latter is
done on a nightly basis, so that documentation is refreshed over
night.

There currently exists two main sections of documentation:

- TraP: this section deals with setting up and running the transients
  pipeline, as well as more details about the individual recipes.

- TKP: this section deals with the underlying modules and algorithms
  used in the transients pipeline.

Using the intersphinx extension, links can be and are created between
the two documentation sections.

Doc strings
-----------

The doc strings also follow pretty much the suggestions in PEP 8. They
are relatively relaxed, and not all methods will have a proper
docstring. The documentation of the arguments and keyword arguments
follow roughly the convention suggested `by Google
<http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments>`_
(`see also
<http://packages.python.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html#function-definitions>`_);
this is different than the `Sphinx supported style
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/desc.html#info-field-lists>`_, but
feels more readable.




Testing
=======

No (good) piece of software can be without proper tests. In the case
of the TKP library, a (presumably) most tests have come after the fact
(i.e., first the problem was solved, then it was tested if that really
worked properly), and often tests were initially practical use cases,
and not so much stylized unit tests.

As a result, there are probably still many routines that lack proper
unit tests, although more unit tests are still being added.

I suggest to follow at least one simple rule:

.. pull-quote::

   **If a bug shows up and is fixed, or a function is changed, write a
   unit test, detailing the bug (and its fix) or the change.**


Unit tests
----------

The unit tests use the :mod:`unittest2` module. For Python 2.7, this
is the built-in :mod:`unittest` module, but for earlier versions, the
module needs to be installed separately. The unit tests have the
following check at the import level for this::

    import unittest
    try:
        unittest.TestCase.assertIsInstance
    except AttributeError:
        import unittest2 as unittest

Running the unit tests
----------------------

To run the unit tests, there exists a test subdirectory outside of the
TKP package (at :file:`tkp/trunk/tests`). The :file:`runtests.bash`
script sets up the necessary paths and allows to call the various unit
tests as an argument to the script. In the end, this was done to
`ctest` can automatically run each unit test as a separate test (the
various path settings inside the script are optimized for in-build
testing with cmake and ctest).

To run all the tests at once, one can also use the :file:`test.py`
script, provided all the paths are set correctly.


Pipeline tests
--------------

Ultimately, the only way to know if everything works correctly (or as
correct as can be deduced), is by running the transients
pipeline. Work is still in progress to set up a set of simulated data
that will test the various aspects of the pipeline, including proper
source finding, association and classification, even under rare (bad),
but controlled (simulated) circumstances.

For now, I would suggest to have a look at
:file:`/home/evert/work/trap/jobs/bell/control/runtrap.sh`, and work
back from this file for the necessary setup. I have been using this
(small) dataset to at least test the basic functionality of the
transients pipeline. Practically, running these data through the
pipeline should produce about five transients (although none of them
are real: they are just artefacts of, liekely, flux calibration
problems).
