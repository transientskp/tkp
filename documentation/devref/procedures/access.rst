Accessing the Code
==================

All code relating to the core TraP functionality is hosted in the
`transientskp/tkp <https://github.com/transientskp/tkp>`_ ``git`` repository
on `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_.

The repository is currently only available to authorized project members. If
you require access, contact ``git@transientskp.org`` for help. Please *do
not* redistribute the code without authorization.

You will need to be familiar with basic ``git`` operation before you can work
with the codebase. There are many excellent tutorials available: start at the
`Git front page <http://www.git-scm.com/>`_.
