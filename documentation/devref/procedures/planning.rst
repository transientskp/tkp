Planning
========

We aim to make releases of the TraP at the cadence of a few per year. Broadly,
the plan is to alternate technically focused releases, which clean up the
codebase and make behind-the-scenes improvements, with science based releases,
which provide new functionality to end users. Technical releases have odd
numbers; science releases even. We will provide bugfixes, but no new
development, for the most recent release; support for earlier releases is on a
"best efforts" basis only.

At the start of a release cycle, the developers and commissioners will meet to
discuss the issues which will be addressed in the upcoming release. Having
agreed upon a set of goals, a roadmap for the release will be created on the
:ref:`issue-tracker`.

It is generally acceptable to submit minor changes and tweaks, as well as
bugfixes, to the codebase at any time. However, if you are planning a major
change which will have significant repercussions for other developers, or
which causes end-user visible changes, it should be included in the goals for
a particular release and there should be a broad consensus about the plan for
implementation before you begin coding.
