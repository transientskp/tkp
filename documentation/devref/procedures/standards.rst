Coding Standards
================

We do not rigorously enforce a set of coding style rules, with the sole
exception that all indents in Python code should consist of 4 spaces. However,
all code is expected to be considerately written, appropriately (but not
excessively) commented, and as easy to read as possible. Please read `PEP 8`_
carefully and bear it in mind as you work.

You may wish to run ``pylint`` or similar tools on the codebase. Occasionally,
such tools can provide useful hints about how to make your code clearer: by
all means act upon these. However, much of the output of such tools is
subjective: be sure you understand and agree with their recommendations, and
be very reluctant to apply them to pre-existing code without fully considering
the implications.
