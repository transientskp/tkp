Issue Tracker
=============

We keep track of bug reports and feature requests using the `TraP Project
<https://support.astron.nl/lofar_issuetracker/projects/bfmise>`_ on the `LOFAR
Issue Tracker <https://support.astron.nl/lofar_issuetracker/>`_. You will need
to register for the issue tracker separately with `ASTRON
<http://www.astron.nl>`_: see the `LOFAR Wiki
<http://www.lofar.org/operations/doku.php?id=maintenance:lofar_issue_tracker>`_
for details.

We use the issue tracker extensively for project planning and managing
releases. It is not a *hard* requirement that every commit to the repository
refers to a particular issue, but you are strongly encouraged to record your
activities on the tracker and to refer to it in commit messages as
appropriate.
