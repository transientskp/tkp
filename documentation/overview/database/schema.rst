assoccatsource
==============

This table stores the association between an extracted source and one or more
cataloged sources (i.e. VLSS, WENSSm, WENSSp, and NVSS sources).

For every association pair the association parameters, distance_arcsec, r and
loglr are calculated as well. Only source pairs that fullfil the criterion of
an association (:math:`r < r_{lim}`) are accepted and appended to this table.
:math:`r_{lim}` may be specified in the user parsets or tkp.cfg, otherwise it
defaults to 3.717, corresponding to missing :math:`10^{-3}` counterparts (see
`Scheers's thesis <http://dare.uva.nl/en/record/367374>`_, section 3.2.3)


**xrtsrc**
   This refers to the xtrsrcid of the extractedsource

**catsrc**
   This is the id of the catalogedsource that could be associated to the
   extractedsource as its counterpart

**type**
   Type of the association, determined by the association procedure inside the
   database. See under assocxtrsource for types and their descriptions

**distance_arcsec**
   The distance in arcsec between the associated sources, calculated by the
   database using the dot product and Cartesian coordinates

**r**
   The dimensionless distance (De Ruiter radius) between the associated
   sources. It is determined as the positional differences weighted by the
   errors, calculated by the association procedure inside the database (Scheers
   thesis ch3).

**loglr**
   The logarithm of the likelihood ratio of the associated sources, defaults to
   NULL if not calculated (Scheers thesis ch3).


assocxtrsource
==============

This table stores the association between an extracted source and its
runningcatalog counterpart source, where the relation might be of type 1-1, 1-n
or n-1.

**runcat**
   refers to the runcatid in runningcatalog.  It is considered as the "base" id
   of a lightcurve, whereas the lightcurve consist of multiple frequency bands
   and Stokes parameters.

**xtrsrc**
   This is the id of the extracted source that could be associated to
   runningcatalog source.  Together, the runcat_id and the xtrsrc form a unique
   pair.

**type**
    Type of association, and its description.  n-m, where n is the number of
    runningcatalog sources, and m the number of extractedsources.
    Type 1: 1-1 association; type 2: 1-n (one-to-many) association; type 3:
    n-1, many-to-one association; type 4: n-m (many-to-many) association; type
    5: 0-1 (zero-to-one) association, a new source.

**distance_arcsec**
   The distance in arcsec between the associated sources, calculated by the
   database using the dot product Cartesian coordinates

**r**
   The dimensionless distance (De Ruiter radius) between the associated
   sources. It is determined as the positional differences weighted by the
   errors, calculated by the association procedure inside the database (Scheers
   thesis chapter 3).

**loglr**
   The logarithm of the likelihood ratio of the associated sources, defaults to
   NULL if not calculated (Scheers thesis ch3).


.. _schema-assocskyrgn:

assocskyrgn
===========
(See also :ref:`skyregion table <schema-skyregion>`.)
This table records which :ref:`runningcatalog <schema-runningcatalog>` sources
we expect to see in any given skyregion. This serves two purposes: 
it allows us to determine when we *do not* see previously detected sources, 
presumably because they have dropped in flux 
(see :py:func:`tkp.db.monitoringlist.get_nulldetections`). 
It also allows us to determine whether a new runningcatalog entry (i.e. 
a newly detected source without associated historical detections) is being 
detected for the first time because it is actually a new transient, or 
if it is simply the first time that region of sky has been surveyed
(see :py:func:`tkp.db.associations._insert_new_transient`).

This table is updated under 2 circumstances:

- A new skyregion is processed, and associations must be made with pre-existing
  runcat entries (see SQL function ``updateSkyRgnMembers``).
- A new runningcatalog source is added, and must be associated with pre-existing
  skyregions 
  (see :py:func:`tkp.db.associations._insert_new_runcat_skyrgn_assocs`).

**runcat**
   References the associated runningcatalog ID.

**skyrgn**
   References the associated skyregion ID.

**distance_deg**
   Records the angular separation between the runningcatalog source and the
   skyregion centre, at time of first association.

catalogedsource
===============

This table contains the sources from renown surveys/catalogues, VLSS, WENSS
and NVSS. The original data (all columns) are downloaded from the CDS Vizier
websites (`VLSS <http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=VIII/79>`_,
`WENSS <http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=VIII/62>`_ and `NVSS
<http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=VIII/65>`_) The catalogues
also contains the exoplanets, of which the entries were provided by
Jean-Mathias Griessmeier.

This table will be pre-loaded in the database, in order to have it available
all the time. As opposed to the runningcatalog, the catalogedsources table is
static and fixed and won't change during runs.


**id**
    Every inserted catalog source gets a unique id, generated sequentially by
    the database.

    (``decl`` = 31.3 → ``zone`` = 31, ``decl`` = 31.9 → ``zone`` = 31). This
    column is primarly for speeding up source look-up queries.

**ra**
    The right ascension (RA) of the source in J2000 degrees.

**decl**
    The declination (decl) of the source in J2000 degrees.

**minor**
    Minor axis of deconvolved component size, in arcsec

**minor_err**
    Mean error on minor axis, in arcsec

pipeline database.


**id**
    Every catalog gets a unique id, generated sequentually by the database.

**name**

**fullname**
    The (nearly) full name under which the catalog is known, e.g. 'NRAO VLA
    Sky Survey'


classification
==============

This table contains classification of transients


dataset
=======

This table contains the information about a dataset. A dataset is nothing more
than a collection of images grouped together for processing. When the same
group is reprocessed, and the dataset.inname is identical (e.g. when the
processing runs with other trap parameters), the rerun is incremented by 1, but
the id is auto-incremented as well, treating it as an independent dataset.


**id**
    Every dataset gets a unique id. The id is generated by the database.

**rerun**
    The value indicates how many times a dataset with a given description was
    processed by the pipeline. Note that every dataset still has a unique id,
    even when it was reprocessed.
    At insertion time, by the insertDataset() SQL function, this is incremented
    by 1 when the description of the dataset is already present in the table,
    otherwise defaults to 0.

    Not being used.

**process_start_ts**
    The timestamp of the start of processing the dataset, generated by the

    parset file or the tkp.cfg file. See the :ref:`PySE documentation <pyse>`
    for more information.

    the source finder parset file or the tkp.cfg file. See the :ref:`PySE
    documentation <pyse>` for more information.

    A description of the dataset, with a maximum of 100 characters.

**node(s)**
    Determine the current and number of nodes in case of a sharded database
    set-up.

extractedsource
===============

This table contains all the extracted sources (measurements) of an image.
Maybe source is not the right description, because measurements may be made
that were erronous and do not represent a source.

Most values come from the sourcefinder procedures, and some are auxiliary
deduced values generated by the database.

This table is empty *before* an observation. *During* an observation new
sources are inserted into this table. *After* an observation this table is
dumped and transported to the catalog database.

All detections (measurements) found by sourcefinder are appended to this table.
At insertion time some additional auxiliary parameters are calculated by the
database as well. At anytime, no entries will be deleted or updated.
The TraP may add forced-fit entries to this table as well. Then
``extract_type`` is set to 1.

**id**
    Every inserted source/measurement gets a unique id, generated by the
    database.

**image**
    The reference id to the image from which this sources was extracted.

**zone**
    The zone id in which the source declination resides, calculated by the
    database.  The sphere is devided into zones of equal width: currently fixed
    to 1 degree, and the zone is effectively the truncated declination.
    (decl=31.3 => zone=31, decl=31.9 => zone=31). This column is primarly for
    speeding up source look-up queries.

**ra**
    Right ascension of the measurement [in J2000 degrees], calculated by the
    sourcefinder procedures.

**decl**
    Declination of the measurement [in J2000 degrees], calculated by the
    sourcefinder procedures.

    gaussian fit and systematic errors, calculated by the database at insertion time.

**decl_err**
    The 1-sigma error on declination [in arcsec], 
    the square root of the quadratic sum of the gaussian fit and systematic errors, 
    calculated by the database at insertion time.

**ra_fit_err**
    The 1-sigma error from the source fitting for ra [in arcsec], calculated by the
    sourcefinder procedures. NOTE: the db unit is in arcsec, while the
    sourcefinder produces degrees, so be careful with convertions.

**decl_fit_err**
    The 1-sigma error from the source fitting for declination [in arcsec],
    calculated by the sourcefinder procedures. NOTE: the db unit is in arcsec,
    while the sourcefinder produces degrees, so be careful with convertions.

**ra_sys_err**
    The systematic error on ra, as determined after source finder testing
    by Dario Carbone and reported at 2012-12-04 `TKP Meeting
    <https://speakerdeck.com/transientskp/source-finder-testing-overview-and-status>`_,
    to be set at 20 arcsec.

**decl_sys_err**
    The systematic error on decl, as determined after source finder testing
    by Dario Carbone and reported at 2012-12-04 `TKP Meeting
    <https://speakerdeck.com/transientskp/source-finder-testing-overview-and-status>`_,
    to be set at 20 arcsec.

**x, y, z**
    Cartesian coordinate representation of (ra,decl), calculated by the
    database at insertion time.

**racosdecl**
    The product of ra and cosine of the declination. Helpful in source look-up
    association queries where we use the De Ruiter radius as an association
    parameter.

**margin**
    Used for association procedures to take into account sources that lie close
    to ra=0 & ra=360 meridian.
    * True: source is close to ra=0 meridian
    * False: source is far away enough from the ra=0 meridian
    * NOTE & TODO: This is not implemented yet.

**det_sigma**
    The sigma level of the detection (Hanno's thesis): 20*(f_peak/det_sigma)
    gives the rms of the detection. Calculated by the sourcefinder procedures.

    are:

        * ``NULL``: gaussian fit
        * ``NULL``: moments fit
        * ``1``: forced fit to pixel

**node(s)**
    Determine the current and number of nodes in case of a sharded database
    set-up.


frequencyband
=============

This table contains the frequency bands that are being used inside the
database.  Here we adopt the set of pre-defined Standard LOFAR Frequency Bands
and their bandwidths as defined for `MSSS
<http://www.lofar.org/wiki/doku.php?id=msss:documentation#standard_msss-lba_frequency_bands>`_.
Included are frequency bands outside the LOFAR bands, in order to match the
external catalogue frequency bands.  When an image is taken at an unknown
band, it is added to this table by the SQL function ``getBand()``. To make it
possible to easily compare images with slightly different effective
frequencies, new bands are constructed by rounding the effective frequency to
the nearest MHz, and assuming a band width of 1 MHz.

**id**
    Every frequency band has its unique id, generated by the database.

**freq_central**
    The central frequency of the defined frequency band. (Note that this is not
    the effective frequency, which is stored as a property in the image table.)

**freq_low**
    The low end of the frequency band.

**freq_high**
    The high end of the frequency band.



image
=====

This table contains the images that are being or were processed in the TraP. 
Note that the format of the image is not stored as an image property. 
An image might be a composite of multiple images, but it is not yet defined how
the
individual values for effective frequency, integration times, etc are
propagated to 
the columns of the ``image`` table.
`The CASA Image description for LOFAR
<http://www.lofar.org/operations/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=public:documents:casa_image_for_lofar_0.03.00.pdf>`_
describes the structure of a LOFAR CASA Image, 
from which most of the data of the ``image`` table originates from. 

An image is characterised by

* observation timestamp (taustart_ts).
* integration time (tau)
* frequency band (band) 
* Stokes parameter (stokes)

A group of images that belong together (defined by user, but not specified any
further) are in the same data set (i.e. they have the same reference to
dataset).

**id**
    Every image gets a unique id, generated by the database.

**dataset**
    The dataset to which the image belongs to. 

**tau** 
    The integration time of the image. This is a quick reference number related
    to tau_time, similar as to which band is related to central frequency.
    Currently this is not used.

**band** 
    The frequency band at which the observation was carried out. Its value
    refers to the id in frequencyband, where the frequency bands are
    predefined. The image's effective frequency falls within this band. If an
    image has observation frequency that is not in this table, a new entry will
    be created based an the effective

**stokes** 
    The Stokes parameter of the observation. 1 = I, 2 = Q, 3 = U and 4 = V. 
    The Stokes parameter originates or is read from the CASA Main table in the
    coords subsection from the ``stokesX`` record. 
    The char value is converted by the database to one of the four (tiny)
    integers.

**tau_time** 
    The integration time (in seconds) of the image. 
    The value originates or is read from the CASA LOFAR_OBSERVATION table 
    by differencing the ``OBSERVATION_END`` and ``OBSERVATION_START`` data
    fields. 

**freq_eff** 
    The effective frequency (or synonymously rest frequency) (in Hz) at 
    which the observation was carried out. 
    The value originates or is read from the CASA Main table in the coords
    subsection from the ``spectralX`` record and the ``crval`` field. 
    Note that in the case of FITS files the header keywords representing the
    effective frequency are not uniquely defined and may differ per FITS file. 

**freq_bw** 
    The frequency bandwidth (in Hz) of the observation. 
    Value originates or is read from the CASA Main table in the coords
    subsection from the ``spectralX`` record and the ``cdelt`` field. N
    This is a required value and when it is not available an error is thrown.

**taustart_ts** 
    The timestamp of the start of the observation, originating or read from 
    the CASA LOFAR_OBSERVATION table from the ``OBSERVATION_START`` data field.



**rb_smaj** 
    The semi-major axis of the restoring beam, in degrees. 
    Full major axis value originates or is read from the CASA Main table in the imageinfor
    subsection from the ``restoringbeam`` record and is converted at db insertion time.

**rb_smin** 
    The semi-minor axis of the restoring beam, in degrees. 
    Full minor axis value originates or is read from the CASA Main table in the imageinfor
    subsection from the ``restoringbeam`` record and is converted at db insertion time.

**rb_pa** 
    The position angle of the restoring beam (from north to east to the major
    axis), in degrees. 
    Value originates or is read from the CASA Main table in the imageinfor
    subsection from the ``restoringbeam`` record. 

**fwhm_arcsec**
    The full width half maximum of the primary beam, in arcsec. Value not yet
    stored in table.

**fov_degrees**
    The field of view of the image, in square degrees. Not yet stored in table.

**url** 
    The url of the physical location of the image at the time of processing.
    NOTE that this needs to be updated when the image is moved.

**node(s)** 
    Determine the current and number of nodes in case of a sharded database
    set-up.


monitoringlist
==============

This table contains the list of sources that are monitored. This implies that
the source finder software will measure the flux in an image at exactly the
given position.  These positions are 0 by default, since they can be retrieved
by joining with the runningcatalog.

For user defined sources, however, positions may be available that are more
precise than those in the runningcatalog.  Hence the ra and decl columns are
still necessary for these sources.  The runcat refers to the id in the
runningcatalog, when available.  Eg, manually inserted sources with positions
obtained differently will not have a runcat to start with (in which case
runcat will have the NULL value), until the first time the flux has been
measured; then these sources (even when actual upper limits) will be inserted
into extractedsources and runningcatalog, and have a runcat.  They will still
have userentry set to true, so that the position used is that in this table
(the more precise position), not that of the runningcatalog.

**id**
    Every source in the monitoringlist gets a unique id

**runcat**
    Refers to the id in runningcatalog.

**ra**
    The Right Ascension (J2000) of the source

**decl**
    The Declination (J2000) of the source

**dataset**
    Refers to the id in dataset, to which this monitoringlist belongs to.

**userentry**
    Boolean to state whether it is an user inserted soure (true) or by the trap
    (false)


node
====

This table keeps track of zones (declinations) of the stored sources on the
nodes in a sharded database configuration. Every node in such a set-up will
have this table, but with different content.

**node**
    The id of the node

**zone**
    The zone that is available on the node

**zone_min**
    The minimum zone of the zones

**zone_max**
    The maximum zone of the zones

**zone_min_incl**
    Boolean determining whether the minimum zone is included.

**zone_max_incl**
    Boolean determining whether the maximum zone is included.

**zoneheight**
    The zone height of a zone, in degrees

**nodes**
    The total number of nodes in the sharded database configuration.


.. note::

   The following sections on the ``runningcatalog``, ``runningcatalog_flux`` and
   ``temprunningcatalog_flux`` are annotated using the style of mathematical
   notations developed in the :ref:`Appendix <mathematical-diversion>`.

.. _schema-runningcatalog:

runningcatalog
==============
(See :ref:`mathematical-diversion` for explanation of mathematical notation.)

While a single entry in ``extractedsource`` corresponds to an individual
source measurement, a single entry in ``runningcatalog`` corresponds to a
unique astronomical source detected in a specific dataset (series of images).
The position of this unique source is a weighted mean of all its individual
source measurements.  The relation between a ``runningcatalog`` source and all
its measurements in ``extractedsource`` is maintained in ``assocxtrsource``.

The association procedure matches extracted sources with counterpart
candidates in the runningcatalog table.  Depending on their association
parameters (distance and De Ruiter radius) of the ``runningcatalog`` source
and ``extractedsource`` source, the source pair ids are added to
``assocxtrsource``.  The source properties, position, fluxes and their errors
in the ``runningcatalog`` and ``runningcatalog_flux`` tables are then updated
to include the counterpart values from the extracted source as a new
datapoint.

If no counterpart could be found for an extracted sources, it is appended to
``runningcatalog`` as a "new" source (datapoint=1).

**id**
    Every source in the running catalog gets a unique id.

**xtrsrc**
    The id of the extractedsource for which this runningcatalog source was
    detected for the first time.

**dataset**
    The dataset to which the runningcatalog source belongs to.

**datapoints** :math:`= N_\alpha` or equivalently :math:`N_\delta`
    The number of datapoints (or number of times this source was detected)
    that is included in the calculation of the *position* averages.  It is
    assumed that a source's position stays relatively constant across bands
    and therefore all bands are included in averaging the position.

**zone**
    The zone id in which the source declination resides.  The sphere is divided
    into zones of equal width: here fixed to 1 degree, and the zone is
    effectively the truncated declination. (decl=31.3 => zone=31, decl=31.9 =>
    zone=31)

**wm_ra** :math:`= \xi_{\alpha}`
    The weighted mean of RA of the source [in J2000 degrees].

**wm_decl** :math:`=\xi_{\delta}`
    The weighted mean of Declination of the source [in J2000 degrees].

**wm_ra_err**
    The weighted mean of the ra_err of the source [in arcsec]

**wm_decl_err**
    The weighted mean of the decl_err of the source [in arcsec]

.. note::

   I am not sure that the weighted mean of the errors is useful, since the
   weighting is dependent upon the errors themselves.  A simple mean error
   might be more sensible.  -TS 30/01/13

**avg_wra** :math:`=\overline{w_{\alpha}\alpha}`
    The average of ra/ra_err^2, used for calculating the average weight of ra.
    (This alleviates the computations, when we have lots of datapoints.)

**avg_wdecl** :math:`=\overline{w_{\delta}\delta}`
    Analogous to avg_wra.

**avg_weight_ra** :math:`=\overline{w_{\alpha}}`
    The average of 1/ra_err^2, used for calculating the weighted mean of ra.
    (This alleviates the computations, when we have lots of datapoints.)

.. note::
   Is it really more efficient this way? It would be good to get a more detailed
   explanation. -TS 30/01/13

.. _schema-runningcatalog-flux:

runningcatalog_flux
===================

The runningcatalog_flux table contains the averaged flux measurements of a

.. _schema-skyregion:

skyregion
=========
Entries in this table represent regions of sky which have been, or will shortly
be, processed via the usual extract-sources-and-associate procedures.
By listing regions of sky in a dedicated table, we de-duplicate
information that would otherwise be repeated for many images.

When an image is first inserted into the database, the SQL function
``getSkyRgn`` is called. This first checks for the pre-existence of a 
matching skyregion entry. If none exists, then a new entry is created and 
the SQL function ``updateSkyRgnMembers`` is called to update the 
:ref:`assocskyrgn <schema-assocskyrgn>` table as necessary.

See also :ref:`assocskyrgn <schema-assocskyrgn>`.

**dataset**
   Reference to the ``dataset`` id, for the dataset to which the skyregion 
   belongs. This field is needed in order to restrict association to the 
   current dataset.

**centre_ra** and **centre_decl**
    The central coordinates (J2000) (or pointing centre) of the region, in
    degrees. 
    RA and Dec values are read from ``DataAccessor`` metadata. 

**x**, **y** and **z**
    The Cartesian coordinates of centre_ra and centre_decl. 
    Values are calculated by the database from centre_ra and centre_decl.

.. _database_temprunningcatalog:

temprunningcatalog
==================
(See also :ref:`source association detailed logic <database-assoc-details>`.)


Most of the entries in the ``temprunningcatalog`` are identical to those of the 
same name in :ref:`schema-runningcatalog` and :ref:`schema-runningcatalog-flux`,
except updated to include the information from a new ``extractedsource``. 
Those without direct counterparts in those tables are listed below. 

**runcat**
    Reference to the ``runningcatalog`` id. runcat and xtrsrc together form a
    unique combination.

**xtrsrc**
    Reference to the ``extractedsource`` id. runcat and xtrsrc together form a
    unique combination.

**distance_arcsec**

    The De Ruiter radius of the runcat-xtrsrc association, calculated by the
    database.


**inactive**
    During evaluation of the association pairs, some pairs might be set to
    inactive (TRUE), defaults to FALSE.

**beam_semimaj, beam_semimin, beam_pa**
    Not used (yet)





transient
=========

This table contains the detected transients and their characteristics. Based on
the values of the variability indices a source is considered a transient and
appended to the transient table.

We choose to test the null hypothesis, :math:`H_0`, that the source under
consideration is not variable. Contributing terms to :math:`\eta_{\nu}` in the
sum will be of the order of unity, giving a value of roughly one after
:math:`N` measurements.  With the integral probability, we can quantify the
probability of having a value equal to or larger than the :math:`\eta_{\nu}`
obtained from the measurements.


**id**
    Every source in the transient table gets a unique id, set by the database

**runcat**
    Reference to the runningcatalog source to which this transient belongs to.
    Since every trasient has an entry in th erunningcatalog this cannot be
    NULL.

**band**
    The frequency band in which the transient was found, and for which th
    evariability are calculated

**siglevel**
    The significance level of the 2nd variability index value. Calculated by
    the scipy module chisqprob(), where we use :math:`N-1` as the degree of
    freedom

**v_int**
    The first variability index, :math:`V_{\nu}`, based on the integrated flux
    values.

**eta_int**
    The second variability index, :math:`\eta_{\nu}`, based on the integrated
    flux values.

**detection_level**

    The database ID of the rejection

**image**
    A foreign key relationship to the image ID of the rejected image

**rejectreason**
    A foreign key relationship to the ID of the rejectreason

**comment**
    A textfield with more details about the rejectedreason. For example in the
    case of a rejection because of RMS value to high, this field will contain
    the theoretical noise value and the calculated RMS value of the image.

Mathematical diversion
======================

On iteratively updated weighted means
-------------------------------------
We now take a diversion to note the mechanics of storing and updating weighted
means - this happens a lot in the database.

We define the average (specifically, the *arithmetic mean*) of :math:`x` as

.. math::

    \overline{x}_N = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i

where :math:`x_i` is the :math:`i` th measurement of :math:`x`.

We may update this in an iterative fashion.
If we add the next datapoint, :math:`x_{N+1}`, to it, we can build the
new average as:

.. math:: \overline{x}_{N+1} = \frac{N \overline{x}_N + x_{N+1}}{N+1} .
   :label: simple_mean_update

We now treat weighted means.

We first define the weight of the :math:`i` th measurement of x,

.. math::
   w_{x_i} = 1/{e_{x_i}}^2

where :math:`e_{x_i}` is the one-sigma error in the :math:`i` th measurement
of x.

We can now define a weighted mean of N measurements of :math:`x`;
:math:`\xi_{x_N}` as:

.. math::

    \xi_{x_N} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{x_i} x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{x_i}}.

To update this weighted average,
we first define the sum of the weights as

.. math::

    W_{x_N} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{x_i}

we may then calculate the  weighted average after N+1 measurements as:

.. math:: \xi_{x_{N+1}} =   \frac{ W_{x_N} \xi_{{x_N}} + w_{{x_{N+1}}}x_{N+1}}
                                 { W_{x_N} + w_{x_{N+1}} }
   :label: wt_mean_update_1

Note, if we define the mean or 'bar' operator such that:

.. math::

   \overline{y}_{N} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i}{N}

for any variable :math:`y`, then

.. math::

   \overline{w}_{x_N} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{x_i}}{N} = \frac{W_{x_N}}{N}

and we may use the formula:

.. math:: \xi_{x_{N+1}} =
    \frac{ N \overline{w}_{x_N} \xi_{x_N} + w_{x_{N+1}}x_{N+1}}
         { N \overline{w}_{x_N} + w_{x_{N+1}} }
   :label: wt_mean_update_2

(Note how this simplifies if :math:`w_i = 1 \quad \forall i`)

.. warning::
   For tracking Ra and Dec  (:math:`\alpha` and :math:`\delta`) weighted
   means, we substitute

   .. math::  N \overline{ w_{\alpha_N} } \xi_{\alpha_N} =
              N \overline{ (w_{\alpha} \alpha )_N}

   to yield another manipulation of the update formula:

   .. math:: \xi_{\alpha_{N+1}} =
       \frac{ N \overline{ (w_{\alpha} \alpha )_N} + w_{\alpha_{N+1}}\alpha_{N+1}}
            { N \overline{w}_{\alpha_N} + w_{\alpha_{N+1}} }
      :label: wt_mean_update_3

   **Note that this requires that we also keep track of the extra aggregate
   value:** :math:`\overline{ (w_{\alpha} \alpha )_N}`, which is probably
   unnecessary given that we are not performing reduced-:math:`\chi^2` stats
   on the position.

In general, we perform similar tricks with aggregate values (i.e. storing the
'barred' values of variables) throughout the database code. This has pros and
cons - it makes the equations below a little prettier (and possibly simpler to
compute), but requires many multiplications and divisions by the factor
:math:`N` (hence, also possibly harder to compute - this may be worth careful
consideration during the next big code review).

On 'aggregated' variability indexes
-----------------------------------

We now explain how running averages are used to compute the 'variability indices'
we use in identifying sources which may be intrinsically transient or variable.
(Adopted from Bart Scheers' PhD thesis.)

The first variability indicator, the proportional flux variability of a
source, is expressed as the ratio of the sample standard deviation, and mean,
of the flux :math:`I`; that is to say:

.. math::

   V = \frac{ s}{ \overline{I} }

where :math:`s` is the unbiased sample standard deviation:

.. math::

   s = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( I_i - \overline{I}  \right)^2 }

.. note::

   In general, we may consider calculating all these values per frequency-band
   and subscript them by band central frequency :math:`\nu`, but we neglect such
   details here for simplicity.

Written in its well known 'aggregate' form, it is now easy to handle bulk
data, and is defined as

.. math::

    V = \frac{1}{\overline{I}}
              \sqrt{ \frac{N}{N-1}
                        \left( \overline{{I}^2} - \overline{I}^2  \right)
                   }

The second indicator, the significance of the flux variability, is based on
reduced :math:`\chi^2` statistics. We derive the aggregate form here.

We begin with the familiar reduced-:math:`\chi^2` formula, except with the
regular arithmetic mean :math:`\overline{I}` replaced by the
weighted mean :math:`\xi_{I_N}`,

.. math::

   \xi_{I_N} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i I_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i}
         = \frac{\overline{w_i I_i} }{ \overline{w_i}},

resulting in:

.. math::

   \eta = \frac{1}{N-1}
                 \sum_{i=1}^N
                    \frac{\left(I_i - \xi_{I_N} \right)^2}
                        {e_i^2}

where :math:`e_i` is the estimated uncertainty, or standard deviation,
in :math:`I_i`.  We may rewrite this using :math:`\frac{1}{e_i^2} = w_i`:

.. math::

   \eta = \frac{N}{N-1}\lgroup \frac{1}{N}
                 \sum_{i=1}^N w_i \left(I_i - \xi_{I_N} \right)^2 \rgroup

Expanding inside the brackets gives:

.. math::
   \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N
      w_i \left( I_i^2 - 2\xi_{I_N} I_i + \xi_{I_N}^2 \right)

    = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N w_i I_i^2
      - 2\xi_{I_N} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N w_i I_i
      + \xi_{I_N}^2 \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N w_i

   = \overline{w_i I_i^2} - 2\xi_{I_N} \overline{w_i I_i} +\xi_{I_N}^2 \overline{w_i}
      \qquad .

Expanding for :math:`\xi_{I_N}` results in the final aggregate form of
the reduced-:math:`\chi^2`:

.. math::

    \eta = \frac{N}{N-1}
                 \left(
                    \overline{w {I}^2}
                    -
                    \frac{\overline{w I}^2}{\overline{w}}
                 \right)
