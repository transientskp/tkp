Source Association
******************
.. |last_updated| last_updated::

Source association—the process by which individual measurements recorded from
an image corresponding to a given time, frequency and Stokes parameter are
combined to form a lightcurve representing an astronomical source—is
fundamental to the goals of the Transients KSP. However, the process is
complex and may be counterintuitive. A thorough understanding is essential
both to enable end-users to interpret pipeline results and to inform pipeline
design decisions.

Here, we summarise the various possible results of source association,
highlighting potential issues. For a full discussion of the algorithms
involved, the user is referred to the thesis by `Scheers
<http://dare.uva.nl/en/record/367374>`_.

==========================================
Database Structure & Association Procedure
==========================================

The structure of the database is discussed in detail :ref:`elsewhere
<database_schema>`: here, only a brief overview of the relevant tables is
presented.

Each measurement (that is, a set of coordinates, a shape, and a flux) taken is
inserted into the ``extractedsource`` table. Many such measurements may be
taken from a single image, either due to "blind" source finding (that is,
automatically attempting to locate islands of significant bright pixels), or
by a user-requested fit to a specific position.

The association procedure knits together ("associates") the measurements in
``extractedsource`` which are believed to originate from a single
astronomical source. Each such source is given an entry in the
``runningcatalog`` table which ties together all of the measurements by means
of the ``assocxtrsource`` table. Thus, an entry in ``runningcatalog`` can be
thought of as a reference to the lightcurve of a particular source.

Each lightcurve may be composed of measurements in one or more frequency bands
(as defined in the ``frequencyband`` table). Within each band flux
measurements are collated. These include the average flux of the source in
that band, as well as assorted measures of variability. Each row in the
``runningcatalog_flux`` table contains flux statistics of this sort for a
given band of a given flux. Thus, each row in ``runningcatalog`` may be
associated with both multiple rows in ``extractedsource`` and in
``runningcatalog_flux``.  Bear in mind, however, that each lightcurve has a
*single* average position associated with it, stored in the ``runningcatalog``
table.

When a new source measurement is made, the association procedure compares it
against the records in ``runningcatalog``. Note that the comparison is based
upon position *only*: an association is made if the new measurement is a good
fit with a position in ``runningcatalog``, regardless of the time or frequency
associated with it. After the association has been made, the position recorded
for the source in ``runningcatalog`` is updated to take account of the new
measurement.

It is important to note that source association must as far as possible be
*commutative*. That is, given a set of measurements, the final contents of the
database should not be dependent upon the order of their insertion. This is
not possible in the general case—it would involve a quadratic number of
source comparisons—but source association procedures should be designed with
this goal in mind. In particular, we require that source association be
commutative if all measurements made at time :math:`t_n` are inserted and
associated before any measurements made at time :math:`t_{n+1}`.

Case Studies
------------

Here we will discuss the various outcomes which are possible from the source
association process under different conditions. In the following, individual
timesteps are indicated by the notation :math:`t_i` and individual flux measurements
(that is, at a particular time/band/Stokes) by :math:`f_j`. Lightcurves (entries in
``runningcatalog``) are indicated by :math:`L_k`; the flux measurements which
constitute a particular lightcurve are linked to the :math:`L_k` symbol by means of a
coloured line.

Single Frequency Band
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We start by considering observations with only a single frequency band.

One-to-One Association
""""""""""""""""""""""

.. graphviz:: assoc/one2one.dot

In this simplest case all the flux measurements are unambiguously associated
in order. A single lightcurve is generated. The calculated average flux of the
lightcurve :math:`L_1` is :math:`\overline{f_{1\cdots{}4}}`.

One-to-Many Association
"""""""""""""""""""""""

.. graphviz:: assoc/one2many.dot

Here, both :math:`f_3` and :math:`f_4` can be associated with the lightcurve
containing :math:`f_2` and :math:`f_1`: a "one-to-many" association.  Since
:math:`f_3` and :math:`f_4` are distinct, though, they result in *two* entries
in the ``runningcatalog`` table, or, equivalently, two lightcurves:
:math:`L_1` with average flux :math:`\overline{f_{1,2,3,5}}` and :math:`L_2`
with average flux :math:`\overline{f_{1,2,4,6}}`.

Note that :math:`f_1` and :math:`f_2`: are now being counted *twice*. Even if
:math:`f_3` and :math:`f_4` each contribute only half the total flux of
:math:`f_2`, the total brightness reached by summing all the lightcurve fluxes
*increases* when this occurs. Equivalently, increasing the spatial resolution
of the telescope causes the sky to get brighter!

Many-to-One Association
"""""""""""""""""""""""

.. graphviz:: assoc/many2one.dot

This situation is similar to that seen above, but in reverse. Initially, two
lightcurves are seen :math:`L_1` consisting of :math:`f_1` and :math:`f_3` and
:math:`L_2` consisting of :math:`f_2` and :math:`f_4`. However, at timestep
:math:`t_3` a new measurement is made, :math:`f_5`, which is associated with both
:math:`L_1` and :math:`L_2`. This, and the subsequent measurement :math:`f_6`,
are then appended to both lightcurves, resulting in :math:`L_1` having average
flux :math:`\overline{f_{1,3,5,6}}` and :math:`L_2` having average flux
:math:`\overline{f_{2,4,5,6}}`. Again, note that :math:`f_5` and :math:`f_6`
are counted twice.

Many-to-Many Association
""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::

    First we illustrate "true" many-to-many association. However, for reasons
    that will become obvious, this is never actually performed: instead, we
    reduce it to a simpler, one-to-one or one-to-many association.

.. graphviz:: assoc/many2many.dot

As shown above, many-to-many association grows quadratically in complexity, as
every possible combination of sources involved in the association results in a
new lightcurve. Further, assuming that neither the sky nor the telescope
configuration change significantly from observation to observation, it's
likely that subsequent measurements will also result in many-to-many
associations, doubling the number of lightcurves at every timestep.

It should be obvious that the scenario described is untenable. Instead, all
many-to-many associations are automatically reduced by only taking the source
pairs with the smallest De Ruiter radii such that they become either
one-to-one or one-to-many associations.

For example, using this criterion, both :math:`f_5` and :math:`f_6` might be
associated with a lightcurve consisting of :math:`f_1` and :math:`f_3` in the
above. The following situation results:

.. graphviz:: assoc/many2many-reduced.dot

Note that :math:`L_2` contains no measurements for timesteps later than
:math:`t_2`: the many-to-many association is removed, but at the cost of
truncating this lightcurve.


Multiple Frequency Bands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We now introduce the added complexity of multiple bands: the same part of the
sky being observed at the same time, but at different frequencies. Here, we
use just two bands for illustration, but in practice several could be
involved.

When considering multiple frequency bands, the same association procedure,
based only on position, as described above, is employed. However, extra care
must be taken to ensure that the commutative nature of association is
preserved.


Multi-Band One-to-One Association
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. graphviz:: assoc/one2one.multiband.dot

In the simplest case, a one-to-one association is made between each
measurement and an entry in the ``runningcatalog`` table. A single lightcurve
results, which we label :math:`L_1`, but for which two average fluxes are
calculated: :math:`\overline{f_{1\cdots{}4}}` in band 1 and
:math:`\overline{f_{5\cdots{}8}}` in band 2.

Multi-Band One-to-Many Association
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. graphviz:: assoc/one2many.multiband.dot

Initially, we proceed as above. However, at :math:`t_3`, a one-to-many
association takes place in Band 1. That band therefore bifurcates, and we are
left with two lightcurves: :math:`L_1` and :math:`L_2`.

No such bifurcation is seen in Band 2. The single measurement :math:`f_9` may
be associated with one or both of :math:`L_1` and :math:`L_2`, depending on
their relative positions. In the former case, one of the lightcurves is
truncated in Band 2. In the latter, a chain of one-to-many associations takes
place with measurements in this band, as both :math:`f_9` and :math:`f_{10}`
are associated with both lightcurves.

In the situation shown, the resulting average fluxes for :math:`L_1` are
:math:`\overline{f_{1,2,3,5}}` in Band 1 and
:math:`\overline{f_{7\cdots{}10}}` in Band 2, while those for :math:`L_2` are
:math:`\overline{f_{1,2,4,6}}`  and :math:`\overline{f_{7\cdots{}10}}`
respectively. Note that the entire flux in Band 2, as well as :math:`f_1` and
:math:`f_2`, is now counted twice.

Multi-Band Many-to-One Association
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. graphviz:: assoc/many2one.multiband.dot

At first, :math:`L_1` and :math:`L_2` are completely independent. However, at
:math:`t_3`, :math:`f_5` undergoes a many-to-one association with both of
them. The same applies to :math:`f_6`. In Band 2, the lightcurves remain
independent.  :math:`L_1` therefore has average fluxes
:math:`\overline{f_{1,3,5,6}}` in Band 1 and :math:`\overline{f_{7,9,11,13}}`
in Band 2, and :math:`L_2` has average fluxes :math:`\overline{f_{2,4,5,6}}`
in Band 1 and :math:`\overline{f_{8,10,12,14}}` in Band 2.

Multi-Band Many-to-One Association (2)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. graphviz:: assoc/many2one.crossband.dot

In this case, we initially have two separate lightcurves. However, at
:math:`t_3`, :math:`f_{13}` is associated with both lightcurves in Band 2,
while :math:`f_{14}` is associated with neither. Three lightcurves result, as
shown.

It is worth considering the ordering of database insertion at this point. In
particular, consider that either one of :math:`f_6` and :math:`f_{14}` may be
inserted before the other. After each insertion, the average position of the
``runningcatalog`` entry is recalculated, and this may affect future
associations.

For example, assume that :math:`f_6` is inserted before :math:`f_{14}`. In
this case, the average position of :math:`f_{2,4,6,10,12}` is not associated
with :math:`f_{14}`. However, if :math:`f_{14}` were to be inserted first, it
would be compared for association with the average position of
:math:`f_{2,4,10,12}`. This may well produce a different result!

For obvious reasons, it is desirable for the database contents to be
independent of the order of insertion (otherwise, its ultimate contents
become non-deterministic given the input data). For this reason, every
insertion at a given timestep causes the associations for *all* datapoints at
that timestep to be revaluated, rather than simply the inserted measurement
simply being associated with the already extant lightcurves.

==========
Discussion
==========

It is immediately obvious from the examples given above that, in all but the
simplest cases, there is potential for confusion here. In particular, note
that simply summing the average fluxes of all the lightcurves in the
``runningcatalog_flux`` table in a given band is not an appropriate way to
estimate the total brightness of the sky: this may count individual flux
measurements multiple times.

Further, the way the source association is handled may result in false
detections of transients. In the case of a one-to-many association, for
example, a single bright source can be associated with two sources each of a
fraction of the brightness. This results in two lightcurves, both containing a
(very transient like!) sudden step in flux. A similar outcome can, of course,
also result from a many-to-one association.

There are two potential areas of improvement which should be investigated.

.. rubric:: Flux division

In a one-to-many or many-to-one association, rather than simply allocating the
full flux of the "one" measurement to each of the "many" lightcurves, it
could be split such that each was only allotted a portion of the total. In this
way, the total brightness of the sky could be maintained.

The most appropriate division is not obvious. A simple model could allocate
each of :math:`n` lightcurves a fraction :math:`1/n` of the total flux of the
single measurement. A more elaborate procedure would weight the allocation by
the flux in each of the :math:`n` lightcurves, such that brighter sources are
allocated a larger fraction of the flux.

Whatever flux allocation procedure is adopted, however, involves making
assumptions about what fraction should be allocated to each source.
Further, it may also increase the computational complexity in the
database, as lightcurve statistics are no longer simply calculated over
source measurements, but must also take account of fractional allocations.

.. rubric:: Smarter association

The current association procedure is purely based on the positions of the
sources and their uncertainties. By incorporating more information about
the sources, ambiguities in association could often be avoided.

For example, consider the case of a many-to-many association involving an
extended source and a point source. It is likely perfectly reasonable to
assume that the measurement of the extended source at time :math:`t_2`
should only be associated with the extended source at time :math:`t_1`,
and similarly for the point source: in this way, the many-to-many
association can be easily reduced to a much simpler case.

Again, though, a number of assumptions go into any procedure like this. In
particular, given that our ultimate aim is to detect transient and
variable sources, we should be wary of any procedure that implicitly
assumes the sky is unchanging. Further, again the issue of database
complexity should be considered: incorporating more logic of this sort is
expensive, in terms of both compute and developer time.

===============
Recommendations
===============

Although it is clear that improvements can and will need to be made to the
procedures adopted, it is not immediately obvious how best to proceed.
Therefore, it is suggested that refinements be deferred until more practical
experience has been obtained.

To that end, we suggest the following:

#. Commissioners and scientists working with the lightcurve database, as well
   as developers of tools designed to detect transients based upon it, must
   familiarize themselves with the issues described above.

#. The `TKP Lightcurve Archive <http://archive.transientskp.org/>`_ should be
   explicit about which measurements have gone into a displayed lightcurve or
   other measurement. The figures which accompany this document are easy to
   programmatically generate using `GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_, and
   show clearly the heritage of a given lightcurve; we suggest, therefore,
   that they or a derivative of them should be shown on the website.

#. As more source measurements are collected, statistics can be collected to
   demonstrate to what extent the problems anticipated are observed in
   real-world use. For example, in the ideal case, the total number of
   measurements included in all the lightcurves would be equal to the number
   of measurements made on images; in practice, however, the former will be
   bigger, since measurements may be counted twice. Observing the
   "overcounting fraction" as the database grows will help understand the
   nature and severity of the problem.


.. _database-assoc-details:

===================
Detailed logic flow
===================
Herein we give an algorithmic description of how the source association routines
work.

.. warning::

   The following detail is really aimed at devs or particularly 
   interested users only, and can certainly be skipped on first reading.

We assume that source extraction has been run on input images,
and new measurements have been inserted into the ``extractedsource`` table.


Clean any previously created temporary listings.
------------------------------------------------
To ensure a clean start, we first run ``_empty_temprunningcatalog``, 
which does what it says on the tin.


Generate a list of candidate runningcatalog-extractedsource associations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

 _insert_temprunningcatalog(image_id, deRuiter_r, radius=0.03)
 Select matched sources

 Here we select the extractedsource that have a positional match
 with the sources in the running catalogue table (runningcatalog).
 Those sources which *do* have a potential match, will be inserted into the
 temporary running catalogue table (temprunningcatalog).

(See also: :ref:`database_temprunningcatalog`. )

This function generates a temporary table listing possible associations with
previously catalogued sources. 

For a given image_id,
 - Select all the relevant extractedsource entries, and
 - For each extractedsource, create a bunch of table entries detailing
   candidate associations with runningcatalog entries which are:
   
   - In the same declination zone as the extractedsource
   - Have a weighted mean position for which the RA and DEC are within a box
     of half-width ``radius`` degrees from the extractedsource. 
     (This places a hard limit on the maximum association radius).
   - Have a weighted mean position within a user-specified DeRuiter radius of 
     the extractedsource.
 - Each of these rows representing a candidate association is populated with all
   the values which would represent an update to the corresponding 
   runningcatalog and runningcatalog_flux entries, if the association is later
   determined to be definitive. 
   
   
Trim the 'many-to-many' links to prevent exponentional database growth
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Especially if we employ a large DeRuiter radius limit, we may generate
a large number of candidate associations which result in a complex 
web of possible lightcurves. We reduce this to a more manageable situation
by trimming some of the 'weaker' candidate associations:

::

 _flag_many_to_many_tempruncat()
 Select the many-to-many association pairs in temprunningcatalog.

 By flagging the many-to-many associations, we reduce the
 processing to one-to-many and many-to-one (identical to one-to-one)
 relationships
 
First, inspect the temprunningcatalog table: 
 - Select entries for which the extractedsource is listed more than once.
 - Of these entries, select those for which the runcat id is listed more than 
   once in temprunningcatalog.
 - Use this selection to determine the runningcatalog id of minimum 
   DeRuiter radius, for each extracted source which is part of a many-to-many
   set.
 - Then, using this per-extractedsource minimum DR radius, reapply the above 
   filters to select multiply-associated entries, and select all entries 
   for which the runcat id  has a larger than  minimum DR radius to the 
   extractedsource.
 - Return the runcat-extractedsource identifying pair values for all 
   non-optimal entries in many-to-many sets.
 
Finally, use these identifiers to set all these entries as ``inactive = TRUE``.

Or, in pseudo-mathematical terms, tempruncat describes the edges of a graph, 
linking nodes (sources) from two spaces 
(previous runcat entries, newly extracted entries). 
(There are no intra-space links).
``_flag_many_to_many_tempruncat()`` trims this graph using 
the DeRuiter radius as a weeding tool, to ensure that any connected sub-graph 
has multiple nodes in *at most* one of the two spaces.

Deal with the  'one-to-many' runcat-to-extractedsource link sub-graphs
----------------------------------------------------------------------
When we observe two new sources in the region of a previous known source,
it is unclear if this is due to increased resolution, or a new source.
To resolve this, we hedge our bets and replace the old single runcat entry
with two new entries - these are identical up to the current 'fork'.

::

	_insert_1_to_many_runcat

    Insert new entries for the extracted sources that belong to one-to-many
    associations in the runningcatalog. 
    
    (These entries will be assigned new runcat ids).
    

    Since for the one-to-many associations (i.e. one runcat source
    associated with multiple extracted sources) we cannot a priori
    decide which counterpart pair is the correct one, or whether all
    are correct (in the case of a higher-resolution image),
    all extracted sources are added as a new source to
    the runningcatalog, and they will replace the (old; lower resolution)
    runcat source of the association.

    As a consequence of this, the resolution of the runningcatalog
    is increasing over time.


::

	_insert_1_to_many_runcat_flux(conn):
    Insert the fluxes of the extracted sources that belong
    to a one-to-many association in the runningcatalog.

    Analogous to the runningcatalog, extracted source properties
    are added to the runningcatalog_flux table.


These insert the candidate runningcatalog entries which are in one-to-many sets
as multiple new entries in the runningcatalog (and runningcatalog_flux). 
We will come back later and delete those old entries we have superceded.
Note that each new runcat entry links one (new) runcat id, and one 
extractedsource id, so the database constraints are satisfied. 


``_insert_1_to_many_basepoint_assoc`` and ``_insert_1_to_many_assoc``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We now start updating the assocxtrsource table to account for our 1-to-many 
associations.

``_insert_1_to_many_basepoint_assoc`` adds entries linking the newly inserted 
entries in the runningcatalog, with the newly associated extractedsources. 
These are ``type=2``, i.e. marked as part of 1-to-many sets. 

``_insert_1_to_many_assoc`` then inserts new entries into the 
assocxtrsource table, which link the *new* runcat ids with all the 
old extractedsource ids, which (from previous association runs) 
are associated with the (now superceded) runningcatalog 
entries. These association links are marked as ``type=6``. 

Clean up database entries superceded by one-to-many forks
---------------------------------------------------------
Now we clean up all references to runcat entries superceded during our 
processing of 1-to-many sets.

``delete_1_to_many_inactive_assoc`` now deletes the assocxtrsource entries
referring to superceded runnincatalog ids. We do this by filtering 
temprunningcatalog for the old runcat ids in 1-to-many sets,
which we have since processed.

``delete_1_to_many_inactive_runcat_flux`` does the same thing, acting on 
the runningcatalog_flux table.

``_flag_1_to_many_inactive_runcat`` now uses the same information to set the 
superceded runcat entries as ``inactive = TRUE``.

Next, ``_flag_1_to_many_inactive_tempruncat`` sets the remaining
'active' temprunningcatalog entries in 1-to-many sets to ``inactive = TRUE``,
as we've now finished processing them.

``_delete_1_to_many_inactive_monitoringlist`` using the fact that we have 
set the superceded runningcatalog entries as ``inactive = TRUE``,
we now delete any corresponding entries in the monitoringlist.  

.. warning::

	NB. This does not discriminate between automatic and manual entries. 
	Possibly we might end up deleting user entries as a result?

``_delete_1_to_many_inactive_transient``: same as above, for old transients.
We don't attempt any update / re-insertion here, instead relying on the 
next ``transient_search`` execution to re-identify any valid transients.
 
.. warning::

	As a result, we may end up mis-identifying the ``trigger_xtrsrc`` of 
	transients which are deleted and then re-identified.
 

Process all remaining associations
----------------------------------
We now process all the remaining active associations listed in temprunningcatalog.
:: 

	_insert_1_to_1_assoc:
	Insert remaining associations from temprunningcatalog into assocxtrsource.

``_insert_1_to_1_assoc`` Inserts all the remaining active links listed in tempruncat, into 
assocxtrsource. These links all refer to a still-valid runningcatalog entry
from a previous source association run.
(This actually includes those candidate links in 'many-to-one'
sets, e.g. sources merged due to a lower-resolution image - hence we set 
``type = 3``).

``_update_1_to_1_runcat`` then performs the corresponding update on the
runningcatalog table, copying across the values calculated during the generation
of temprunningcatalog.

``_select_for_update_1_to_1_runcat_flux`` grabs all the columns relevant to 
the runnincatalog_flux entries, from the still active entries in temprunningcatalog.
Each of these entries is then fed, one-by-one, (room for optimization here) to 
``_insert_or_update_1_to_1_runcat_flux``. This checks for a pre-existing 
entry in runningcatalog_flux with the same runcat_band_stokes identifying triple,
and then either updates it or inserts a new one, accordingly.

Process remaining extractedsources (those without associations)
---------------------------------------------------------------
We still need to insert the 'new' sources, i.e. those extractions without 
an identified association.

``_insert_new_runcat(image_id)`` is run first, since the database constraints 
are already satisfied (pre-existent xtrsrc and dataset-id). 
First, we pre-select those extractedsources which were discovered in the 
current image. 
Then we filter to just those which do not have any associations, 
by selecting those extractedsources listed in the image but not in the 
temprunningcatalog  
(A left outer join on xtrsrc where temprunningcatalog.xtrsrc is NULL). 
  
We initialise the averages (position, flux, etc) by pulling in the relevant values from 
extractedsource, and the dataset id from the image table.

``_insert_new_runcat_flux(image_id)`` performs a similar trick to select the 
'new-source' extractsources, then cross-matches against the xtrsrc id to select
the new runcat entries. 
With these in hand it's easy to insert new runcat_flux entries, pulling in the
relevant id from runningcatalog, band and stokes from image table, and flux
values from extractedsource.
 
``_insert_new_assoc(image_id)``
Performs the same routine of grab 'new-source' entries, match new runcat entries,
as  ``_insert_new_runcat_flux`` - it's then trival to insert the relevant entries
in assocxtrsource. 

.. warning::

 Currently we set ``type = 4``, (i.e. many-to-many ???) in _insert_new_assoc.

Cleanup
-------
Now that all the new extractions have been dealt with, we take care of some 
loose ends. 
We ``_empty_temprunningcatalog``, and finally ``_delete_inactive_runcat``
deletes those runningcatalog entries which we have now superceded, via a simple
``inactive = TRUE`` filter.

.. warning:: 

	It's unclear to me why we leave this until last - I don't see where we need
	the inactive runcat entries after ``_delete_1_to_many_inactive_transient``.
	(Though there's no real harm in leaving it till last).
