assoccatsource
==============

This table stores the association between an extracted source and one or more cataloged sources (i.e. VLSS, WENSSm, WENSSp, and NVSS sources). 

For every association pair the association parameters, distance_arcsec, r and loglr are calculated as well. Only source pairs that fullfil the criterion of an association (r < r_lim) are accepted and appended to this table. r_lim may be specified in the user parsets or tkp.cfg, otherwise it defaults to 3.717, corresponding to missing 10^{-3} counterparts (see Scheers's `thesis <http://dare.uva.nl/en/record/367374>`_, section 3.2.3)

==============

This table stores the association between an extracted source and its runningcatalog counterpart source, where the relation might be of type 1-1, 1-n or n-1.

**minor_err**
    Mean error on minor axis, in arcsec

**avg_f_peak**

classification
==============

This table contains classification of transients


dataset
=======

This table contains the information about a dataset. A dataset is nothing more than a collection of images grouped together for processing. When the same group is reprocessed, and the dataset.inname is identical (f.ex. when the processing runs with other trap parameters), the rerun is incremented by 1, but the id is auto-incremented as well, treating it as an independent dataset.


**id**
    Every dataset gets a unique id. The id is generated by the database.

**rerun**
    The value indicates how many times a dataset with a given description was processed by the pipeline. Note that every dataset still has a unique id, even when it was reprocessed.
    At insertion time, by the insertDataset() SQL function, this is incremented by 1 when the description of the dataset is already present in the table, otherwise defaults to 0.

    A description of the dataset, with a maximum of 100 characters.

**node(s)**
    Determine the current and number of nodes in case of a sharded database set-up.

extractedsource
===============

This table contains all the extracted sources (measurements) of an image.  Maybe source is not the right description, because measurements may be made that were erronous and do not represent a source. 

.. Most values come from the sourcefinder procedures, and some are auxiliary deduced values generated by the database.

.. This table is empty BEFORE an observation. DURING an observation new sources are inserted into this table AFTER an observation this table is dumped and transported to the catalog database.

All detections (measurements) found by sourcefinder are appended to this table. At insertion time some additional auxiliary parameters are calculated by the database as well. At anytime, no entries will be deleted or updated.
The TraP may add forced-fit entries to this table as well. Then ``extract_type`` is set to 1.

    Every inserted source/measurement gets a unique id, generated by the database.

**image**
    The reference id to the image from which this sources was extracted.

**zone**
    The zone id in which the source declination resides, calculated by the database.  The sphere is devided into zones of equal width: currently fixed to 1 degree, and the zone is effectively the truncated declination. (decl=31.3 => zone=31, decl=31.9 => zone=31). This column is primarly for speeding up source look-up queries.

**decl_err**
    The 1-sigma error of the declination measurement [in arcsec], calculated by the sourcefinder procedures. NOTE: the unit is in arcsec, while the sourcefinder produces degrees, so be careful with convertions.

**x, y, z**
    Cartesian coordinate representation of (ra,decl), calculated by the database at insertion time.

**racosdecl**
    The product of ra and cosine of the declination. Helpful in source look-up association queries where we use the De Ruiter radius as an association parameter.

**margin**
    Used for association procedures to take into account sources that lie close to ra=0 & ra=360 meridian.
    * True: source is close to ra=0 meridian
    * False: source is far away enough from the ra=0 meridian
    * NOTE & TODO: This is not implemented yet.

**det_sigma**
    The sigma level of the detection (Hanno's thesis): 20*(f_peak/det_sigma) gives the rms of the detection. Calculated by the sourcefinder procedures.

    Reports how the source was extracted by sourcefinder (Hanno's thesis), generated by the sourcefinder procedures:
    
    The currently implemented values:
    NULL: gaussian fit
    NULL: moments fit
    1: forced fit to pixel (by the _insert_user_monitored_source_into_extractedsource() method)

**node(s)**
    Determine the current and number of nodes in case of a sharded database set-up.


frequencyband
=============

This table contains the frequency bands that are being used inside the database. 
Here we adopt the set of pre-defined Standard LOFAR Frequency Bands and their bandwidths as defined for `MSSS <http://www.lofar.org/wiki/doku.php?id=msss:documentation#standard_msss-lba_frequency_bands>`_. 
Included are frequency bands outside the LOFAR bands, in order to match the external catalogue frequency bands.
When an image is taken at an unknown band, it is added to this table by the SQL function ``getBand()``, using the image's effective frequency as central frequency and its bandwidth to determine the low and high end of the band.

**id**
    Every frequency band has its unique id, generated by the database.

**freq_central**
    The central frequency of the defined frequency band. (Note that this is not the effective frequency, which is stored as a property in the image table.)

**freq_low**
    The low end of the frequency band.

**freq_high**
    The high end of the frequency band.



image
=====

This table contains the images that are being or were processed in the TraP. 
Note that the format of the image is not stored as an image property. 
An image might be a composite of multiple images, but it is not yet defined how the
individual values for effective frequency, integration times, etc are propagated to 
the columns of the ``image`` table.
`The CASA Image description for LOFAR <http://www.lofar.org/operations/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=public:documents:casa_image_for_lofar_0.03.00.pdf>`_ describes the structure of a LOFAR CASA Image, 
from which most of the data of the ``image`` table originates from. 

An image is characterised by

* observation timestamp (taustart_ts).
* integration time (tau)
* frequency band (band) 
* Stokes parameter (stokes)

A group of images that belong together (defined by user, but not specified any further) are in the same data set (i.e. they have the same reference to dataset).

**id**
    Every image gets a unique id, generated by the database.

**dataset**
    The dataset to which the image belongs to. 

**tau** 
    The integration time of the image. This is a quick reference number related to tau_time, similar as to which band is related to central frequency. Currently this is not used.

**band** 
    The frequency band at which the observation was carried out. Its value refers to the id in frequencyband, where the frequency bands are predefined. The image's effective frequency falls within this band. If an image has observation frequency that is not in this table, a new entry will be created based an the effective

**stokes** 
    The Stokes parameter of the observation. 1 = I, 2 = Q, 3 = U and 4 = V. 
    The Stokes parameter originates or is read from the CASA Main table in the coords subsection 
    from the ``stokesX`` record. 
    The char value is converted by the database to one of the four (tiny) integers.

**tau_time** 
    The integration time (in seconds) of the image. 
    The value originates or is read from the CASA LOFAR_OBSERVATION table 
    by differencing the ``OBSERVATION_END`` and ``OBSERVATION_START`` data fields. 

**freq_eff** 
    The effective frequency (or synonymously rest frequency) (in Hz) at 
    which the observation was carried out. 
    The value originates or is read from the CASA Main table in the coords subsection 
    from the ``spectralX`` record and the ``crval`` field. 
    Note that in the case of FITS files the header keywords representing the effective frequency 
    are not uniquely defined and may differ per FITS file. 

**freq_bw** 
    The frequency bandwidth (in Hz) of the observation. 
    Value originates or is read from the CASA Main table in the coords subsection 
    from the ``spectralX`` record and the ``cdelt`` field. N
    This is a required value and when it is not available an error is thrown.

**taustart_ts** 
    The timestamp of the start of the observation, originating or read from 
    the CASA LOFAR_OBSERVATION table from the ``OBSERVATION_START`` data field.

**centre_ra** and **centre_decl**
	The central coordinates (J2000) (or pointing centre) of the image in degrees. 
    RA and dec values originate or are read from the CASA Main table in the coords subsection 
    from the ``pointingcenter`` record. 
    Note the conversion from radians to degrees.

**x**, **y** and **z**
    The Cartesian coordinates of centre_ra and centre_decl. 
    Values are calculated by the database from centre_ra and centre_decl. Not yet stored in table.

**rb_maj** 
    The major axis of the restoring beam, in arcsec. 
    Value originates or is read from the CASA Main table in the imageinfor subsection 
    from the ``restoringbeam`` record. 

**rb_min** 
    The minor axis of the restoring beam, in arcsec. 
    Value originates or is read from the CASA Main table in the imageinfor subsection 
    from the ``restoringbeam`` record. 

**rb_pa** 
    The position angle of the restoring beam (from north to east to the major axis), in degrees. 
    Value originates or is read from the CASA Main table in the imageinfor subsection 
    from the ``restoringbeam`` record. 

**fwhm_arcsec**
    The full width half maximum of the primary beam, in arcsec. Value not yet stored in table.

**fov_degrees**
    The field of view of the image, in square degrees. Not yet stored in table.

**url** 
    The url of the physical location of the image at the time of processing. NOTE that this needs to be updated when the image is moved.

**node(s)** 
    Determine the current and number of nodes in case of a sharded database set-up.


monitoringlist
==============

This table contains the list of sources that are monitored. This implies that the source finder software will measure the flux in an image at exactly the given position. 

These positions are 0 by default, since they can be retrieved by joining with the runningcatalog.

For user defined sources, however, positions may be available that are more precise than 
those in the runningcatalog. 
Hence the ra and decl columns are still necessary for these sources.  
The runcat refers to the id in the runningcatalog, when available. 
Eg, manually inserted sources with positions obtained differently will not have 
a runcat to start with (in which case runcat will have the NULL value), 
until the first time the flux has been measured; 
then these sources (even when actual upper limits) will be inserted into extractedsources 
and runningcatalog, and have a runcat.  
They will still have userentry set to true, so that the position used is that 
in this table (the more precise position), not that of the runningcatalog.

**id**
    Every source in the monitoringlist gets a unique id

**runcat**
    Refers to the id in runningcatalog.  

**ra**
    The Right Ascension (J2000) of the source

**decl** 
    The Declination (J2000) of the source

**dataset**
    Refers to the id in dataset, to which this monitoringlist belongs to.

**userentry** 
    Boolean to state whether it is an user inserted soure (true) or by the trap (false)


node
====

This table keeps track of zones (declinations) of the stored sources on the nodes in a sharded database configuration. Every node in such a set-up will have this table, but with different content.

**node**
    The id of the node

**zone**
    The zone that is available on the node

**zone_min**
    The minimum zone of the zones

**zone_max**
    The maximum zone of the zones

**zone_min_incl**
    Boolean determining whether the minimum zone is included.

**zone_max_incl**
    Boolean determining whether the maximum zone is included.

**zoneheight**
    The zone height of a zone, in degrees

**nodes**
    The total number of nodes in the sharded database configuration.

runningcatalog
==============

While a single entry in ``extractedsource`` corresponds to an individual source measurement, 
a single entry in ``runningcatalog`` corresponds to a unique astronomical source 
detected in a specific dataset (series of images). 
The position of this unique source is a weighted mean of all its individual source measurements.
The relation between a ``runningcatalog`` source and all its measurements in ``extractedsource`` 
is maintained in ``assocxtrsource``.

The association procedure matches extracted sources with counterpart candidates 
in the runningcatalog table. 
Depending on their association parameters (distance and De Ruiter radius) of the 
``runningcatalog`` source and ``extractedsource`` source, the source pair ids are added to ``assocxtrsource``. 
The source properties, position, fluxes and their errors in the 
``runningcatalog`` and ``runningcatalog_flux`` tables are then updated to include the 
counterpart values from the extracted source as a new datapoint.

If no counterpart could be found for an extracted sources, it is appended to ``runningcatalog`` 
as a "new" source (datapoint=1).

Weighted means for sources positions and fluxes are calculated according to Bevington, Ch. 4.
If we have a source property :math:`x` and its 1sigma error :math:`e`), its weighted mean is

.. math::

   \overline{\chi_N} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i},

where :math:`N` is the number of datapoints and :math:`w_i = 1/{e_i}^2` is the weight of the :math:`i`-th measurement of :math:`x`.

**id**
    Every source in the running catalog gets a unique id.

**xtrsrc**
    The id of the extractedsource for which this runningcatalog source was detected for the first time.

**dataset**
    The dataset to which the runningcatalog source belongs to.

**datapoints**
    The number of datapoints (or number of times this source was detected) that is included in the calculation of the averages. It is assumed that a source's position stays relatively constant across bands and therefore all bands are included in averaging the position.

**zone**
    The zone id in which the source declination resides.  The sphere is devided into zones of equal width: here fixed to 1 degree, and the zone is effectively the truncated declination. (decl=31.3 => zone=31, decl=31.9 => zone=31)

**wm_ra**
    The weighted mean of RA of the source.

**wm_decl**
    The weighted mean of Declination of the source.

**wm_ra_err**
    The weighted mean of the ra_err of the source

**wm_decl_err**
    The weighted mean of the decl_err of the source

**avg_wra**
    The average of ra/ra_err^2, used for calculating the average weight of ra.
    (This alleviates the computations, when we have lots of datapoints.)

**avg_wdecl**
    Analogous to avg_wra.

**avg_weight_ra**
    The average of 1/ra_err^2, used for calculating the average weight of ra.
        (This alleviates the computations, when we have lots of datapoints.)

**avg_weight_decl**
    Analogous to avg_weight_ra

**x, y, z**
    The Cartesian coordinate representation of wm_ra and wm_decl

**margin**
    Boolean to define that a source is near the 360-0 meridian. Not being used.

**inactive**
    Boolean to set an entry to inactive. 
    This is done during the `source association <database_assoc>` procedure,
    where e.g. the many-to-many cases are handled and an existing entry is replaced 
    by two or more entries.


runningcatalog_flux
===================

The runningcatalog_flux table contains the averaged flux measurements of a runningcatalog source, per band and stokes parameter. The combination runcat, band and stokes is the primary key.

The flux squared and weights are used for calculations of the variability indices, V and eta.

    Reference to the runningcatalog id to which this band/stokes/flux belongs to

**band**
    Reference to the frequency band of this flux

**stokes**

    average of ratio of (int flux) and (int flux errors squared)

**avg_weighted_f_int_sq**
    average of ratio of (int flux squared) and (int flux errors squared)

temprunningcatalog
==================

This table contains temporary results. 
At the beginning of the source association procedures the table is empty. 
At the start, the association query adds candidate pairs (matches between 
sources in ``runningcatalog`` and ``extractedsource``) to the temporary table. 
At insertion time, the query calculates for every found source pair 
the new statistical parameters (weighted means, averages), 
using "archive" values from ``runningcatalog`` and including 
the values from ``extractedsource`` as new datapoints. 
Below, a short description of how this is done is given.

Adding includes the new measurements. 
Then, all types of association relations 
(many-to-1, 1-to-many, etc., as described in the `source association <database_assoc>`, 
are processed.
At the end of this process, the runningcatalog is updated with the new values that now include the last datapoint.

the genuine associations are added as 
When done, this table is emptied again, ready for the next image.

of the association candidates found between 
the extractedsources in an image and their counterparts in ``runningcatalog``. 

The table name is prefixed "temp", since the data are temporarily stored and deleted at the end of the association procedure.
After handling the many-to-many, 1-to-many and many-to-1 relations, 
the ``runningcatalog`` is updated with the new "averages". 
The 0-to-1 and 1-to-0 relations are processed separatedly and do not touch this table.

If we define the average of :math:`x` as 

.. math::

    \overline{x}_N = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i,

then, if we add the next datapoint, :math:`x_{N+1}`-th, to it, we can build the new average as:

.. math::

    \overline{x}_{N=1} = \frac{1}{N=1} \left[ N \overline{x}_N + x_{N+1} \right].

This is slightly different for weighted means. If we have a weighted mean, :math:`\overline{\xi}_N` defined as:

.. math::

    \overline{\xi_N} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i},

and we add the :math:`N+1`-th measurement of :math:`x_{N+1}` and its error :math:`e_{N+1}` 
(ie :math:`w_{N+1} 1/{e_{N+1}}^2`), we get the new average by:

.. math::

    \frac{
            \frac{N\overline{\xi}_N + w_{N+1} x_N+1}{N+1}
         }
         {
            \frac{N\overline{w}_N + w_{N+1} x_N+1}{N+1}
         }
         = 
         \frac{
            N\overline{\xi}_N + w_{N+1} x_N+1
              }
              {
            N\overline{w}_N + w_{N+1} x_N+1
              }.

Storing the averages relaxes the computations and are helpful is calculating the variability indices by simply multiplying the necessary columns.

The first variability indicator, the magnitude of the flux variability of a source, is expressed as the ratio of the sample flux standard deviation. Written in aggregate form, it is now easy to handle bulk data, and is defined as 

.. math::

    V_{\nu} = \frac{1}{\overline{I_{\nu}}} 
              \sqrt{ \frac{N}{N-1}
                     \left( \overline{{I_{\nu}}^2}
                            -
                            \overline{I_{\nu}}^2
                     \right)
                   }

The second indicator, the significance of the flux variability, is based on reduced :math:`\chi^2` statistics. Written in aggregate form it becomes

.. math::

    \eta_{\nu} = \frac{}{}
                 \left(
                    \overline{w {I_{\nu}}^2}
                    -
                    \frac{\overline{w I_{\nu}}^2}{\overline{w}}
                 \right)

Note that the indices are calculated per frequency band (and per Stokes parameter).
The parameters in the last two equations correspond to columns in the tables as follows:

:math:`\overline{I_{\nu}}` to avg_f_peak

:math:`\overline{{I_{\nu}}^2}` to avg_f_peak_sq

:math:`\overline{w {I_{\nu}}^2}` to avg_weighted_f_peak_sq

:math:`\overline{w I_{\nu}}` to avg_weighted_f_peak

:math:`\overline{w}` to avg_f_peak_weight

transient
=========

This table contains the detected transients and their characteristics. Based on the values of the variability indices a source is considered a transient and appended to the transient table.

we choose to test the null hypothesis, :math:`H_0`, that the source under consideration is not variable. Contributing terms to :math:`\eta_{\nu}` in the sum will be of the order of unity, giving a value of roughly one after :math:`N` measurements. 
With the integral probability, we can quantify the probability of having 
a value equal to or larger than the :math:`\eta_{\nu}` obtained from the measurements.


**id**
    Every source in the transient table gets a unique id, set by the database

**runcat**
    Reference to the runningcatalog source to which this transient belongs to. Since every trasient has an entry in th erunningcatalog this cannot be NULL.

**band**
    The frequency band in which the transient was found, and for which th evariability are calculated

**siglevel** 
    The significance level of the 2nd variability index value. Calculated by the scipy module chisqprob(), where we use :math:`N-1` as the degree of freedom
