assoccatsource
==============

This table stores the associations between extracted sources and cataloged sources (i.e. VLSS, WENSSm, WENSSp, and NVSS sources). 

For every association pair the association parameters, distance_arcsec, r and loglr are calculated as well. Only source pairs that fullfil the criterion of an association (r < r_lim) are accepted and appended to this table. r_lim may be specified in tkp.cfg, or otherwise defaults to 3.717, corresponding to missing 10^{-3} counterparts (see Scheers's thesis, section 3.2.3)

This table contains the frequency bands that are available during an observation and for the cataloged sources. 

**id**
    Every frequency band has its unique id.

image
=====

This table contains the images that are being or were processed in the trap.  The only format for now is FITS. The HDF5 format will be implemented later.

An image is characterised by

* observation timestamp (taustart_ts).
* frequency band (band) 
* integration time (tau)

A group of images that belong together (defined by user, but not specified any further) are in the same data set (i.e. they have the same dataset).

**id**
    Every image gets a unique id.

**tau** 
    The integration time of the image. This is a quick reference number related to tau_time, similar to band related to central frequency.

**band** 
    The frequency band at which the observation was carried out

**stokes** 
    The Stokes parameter of the observation. 1 = I, 2 = Q, 3 = U and 4 = V.

**tau_time**

    The url of the physical location of the image at the time of processing.

**node(s)** 
    Determine the current and number of nodes in case of a sharded database set-up.


monitoringlist
==============

This table contains the list of sources that are monitored. This implies that the source finder software will measure the flux in an image at exactly the given position. 

These positions are 0 by default, since they can be retrieved by joining with the runningcatalog.

For user defined sources, however, positions may be available that are more precise than those in the runningcatalog. Hence the ra and decl columns are still necessary for these sources.  The runcat refers to the id in the runningcatalog, when available. Eg, manually inserted sources with positions obtained differently will not have a runcat to start with (in which case runcat will have the NULL value), until the first time the flux has been measured; then these sources (even when actual upper limits) will be inserted into extractedsources and runningcatalog, and have a runcat.  They will still have userentry set to true, so that the position used is that in this table (the more precise position), not that of the runningcatalog.

**id**
    Every source in the monitoringlist gets a unique id
**runcat**
    Refers to the id in runningcatalog.  
**ra**
    The Right Ascension (J2000) of the source
**decl** 
    The Declination (J2000) of the source
**dataset**
    Refers to the id in dataset, to which this monitoringlist belongs to.
**userentry** 
    Boolean to state whether it is an user inserted soure (true) or by the trap (false)


node
====

This table keeps track of zones (declinations) of the stored sources on the nodes in a sharded database configuration. Every node in such a set-up will have this table, but with different content.

**zone**
    The zone that is available on the node
**zone_min**
    The minimum zone of the zones
**zone_max**
    The maximum zone of the zones
**zone_min_incl**
    Boolean determining whether the minimum zone is included.
**zone_max_incl**
    Boolean determining whether the maximum zone is included.
**zoneheight**
    The zone height of a zone, in degrees
**nodes**
    The total number of nodes in the sharded database configuration.

runningcatalog
==============

This table contains all the unique sources that are being detected during an observation.
Extracted sources are being positionally matched with counterpart candidated in the runningcatalog table. Depending on their association parameters the extracted source -- runningcatalog source pair is being added to the assocxtrsource. The source properties, position, fluxes and errors in the runningcatalog and -_flux tables are then updated to include the counterpart values from the extracted source.

TODO: The resolution element (from images table) is not implemented yet.

Extractedsources not in this table are appended when there is no positional match or when a source was detected in a higher resolution image.

We maintain weighted averages for sources positions and fluxes according to Bevington, Ch. 4.
If we have a source property x and error e), its weighted mean is

.. math::

   wm_x = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{w_i x_i}{w_i},

where :math:`w_i = \frac{1}{{e_i}^2}` is the weight of the i-th measurement of
x.

**id**
    Every source in the running catalog gets a unique id.

**xtrsrc**
    The id of the extractedsource for which this runningcatalog source was detected for the first time.

**dataset**
    The dataset to which the runningcatalog source belongs to.

**datapoints**
    The number of datapoints (or number of times this source was detected) that is included in the calculation of the averages.

**zone**
    The zone id in which the source declination resides.  The sphere is devided into zones of equal width: here fixed to 1 degree, and the zone is effectively the truncated declination. (decl=31.3 => zone=31, decl=31.9 => zone=31)

**wm_ra**
    The weighted mean of RA of the source.

**wm_decl**
    The weighted mean of Declination of the source.

**wm_ra_err**
    The weighted mean of the ra_err of the source

**wm_decl_err**
    The weighted mean of the decl_err of the source

**avg_wra**
    The average of ra/ra_err^2, used for calculating the average weight of ra.
    (This alleviates the computations, when we have lots of datapoints.)

**avg_wdecl**
    Analogous to avg_wra.

**avg_weight_ra**
    The average of 1/ra_err^2, used for calculating the average weight of ra.
        (This alleviates the computations, when we have lots of datapoints.)

**avg_weight_decl**
    Analogous to avg_weight_ra



runningcatalog_flux

The 0-to-1 and 1-to-0 relations are processed separatedly and do not touch this table.
