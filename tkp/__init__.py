The TKP package contains python modules used by the LOFAR Transients
Key Project. These modules perform operations necessary to:

- extract sources from (radio) images

- store these sources in a database

- match sources with cataloged sources

- detect variable sources

- classify variable sources


The division in subpackages follows these steps roughly:

- sourcefinder routines

- database routines (storage, association, variable detection)

- classification routines

- utility routines
