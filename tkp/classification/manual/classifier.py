  This module is deprecated and in dire need of code review. (TS 26/02/12)


Classify an object, by parsing it through a user defined decision tree.

This module contains the necessary classes to classify an arbitrary
object, using the decision tree set up in the classification
module. This module can be dynamically imported if necessary, by
storing it in directory given by the path keyword in the Classifier
initializer.

Alternatively, one can run the classifier by pointing it directly at
the entry point of the decision tree.


The actual classification work is done in three parts:

- The Classifier class picks up the object to be classified and the
  main starting point of the decision tree.

- The ClassifiedObject instance will compare each criterion with the
  value of the object attribute, and return a score. The outcomes of
  each comparison are added together to form the total score of that
  ClassifiedObject.

- A Branch behaves similar to a ClassifiedObject, but it evaluates
  multiple ClassifiedObjects, while bypassing a whole other part of
  the tree, based on a criterion. In addition, it can also (like a
  ClassifiedObject) return a score for a whole branch; such a score
  is added to all the individual scores from the evaluated
  ClassifiedObjects.

The object to be classified should have attributes that can be used as
criteria. The `Classifier` will automatically find these attributes
from the object.
