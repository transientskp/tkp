sigma = 4               ; sigma value used for iterave clipping image before RMS calculation
f = 8                   ; determines size of subsection, result will be 1/fth of the image size
low_bound = 1           ; multiplied with noise to define lower threshold
high_bound = 80         ; multiplied with noise to define upper threshold
oversampled_x = 30      ; threshold for oversampled check
elliptical_x = 2.0      ; threshold for elliptical check
min_separation = 10     ; minimum distance to a bright source (in degrees)
