    The formula below for cliplim is pretty subtle. Kappa, sigma
    clipping should be such that the noise is not biased by
    it. Consequently, the clipping boundaries should be such that
    exactly half an independent pixel should exceed it if the map were
    source free. A rigid boundary of 3 sigma is appropriate only if the
    number of independent pixels is about 185 (the number of
    independent pixels equals the number of pixels divided by the
    beamsize in pixels).

    The condition that kappa, sigma clipping may not bias the noise is
    translated in the formula below, using Gaussian statistics. A
    disadvantage of this is that more iterations of kappa, sigma
    clipping are needed, compared to 3 sigma clipping. However, the
    noise values derived are generally significantly different (lower)
    compared to 3 sigma clipping.

    sigma is subtle: if a callable is given, it is passed a copy of the data

    defined above. However, if it isn't callable, sigma is assumed to just set
    a hard limit.
